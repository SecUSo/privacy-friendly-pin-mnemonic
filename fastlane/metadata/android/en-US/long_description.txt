The Privacy Friendly PIN Mnemonic application can be used to find out strategies to memorize a Personal Identification Number (PIN). It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfa

After entering the PIN, the application displays up to five strategies for memorizing the PIN:
1) It draws the shape on the number pad and highlights the numbers corresponding to the PIN.
2) It determines whether the PIN forms a word using the letters of the number pad.
3) It checks if the PIN is in year or date format.
4) It checks if the PIN underlies a mathematical rule.
5) It provides symbols for inventing a little story to facilitate memorizing the PIN.

The application also provides the possibility to practice entering the PIN keeping the preferred mnemonic(s) in mind.

Our app differs from other applications with respect to two aspects:
1. The Privacy Friendly PIN Mnemonic App does not use any permission.
2. The Privacy Friendly PIN Mnemonic App completely relinquishes advertisement.
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising and also shortens battery life.
