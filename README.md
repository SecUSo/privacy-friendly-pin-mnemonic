Privacy Friendly PIN Mnenomic is an Android application which can provide strategies to memorize a 4-digit PIN. Therefore it determines whether the PIN forms a T9-word, underlies a mathematical rule or forms a date or year.

It does not use any permission, as the app can provide its full functionality without the usage of permissions. It also does neither include advertisement nor tracking mechanisms. As a plus taking screenshots of the app is programmatically disabled so that it is not possible to take a screenshot of the entered PIN.  This app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the Technische Universität Darmstadt. 

## Motivation

This application has been developed to be used as a basis for a Privacy Friendly App. Privacy Friendly Apps are group of Android applications which are optimized regarding privacy. Further information can be found on secuso.org/pfa
