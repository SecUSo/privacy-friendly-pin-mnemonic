## Privacy Friendly PIN Mnemonic

Privacy Friendly PIN Mnenomic is an Android application which can provide strategies to memorize a 4-digit PIN. 
Therefore it determines whether the PIN forms a T9-word, underlies a mathematical rule or forms a date or year.

It does not use any permission, as the app can provide its full functionality without the usage of permissions. It also does neither include advertisement nor tracking mechanisms. As a plus taking screenshots of the app is programmatically disabled so that it is not possible to take a screenshot of the entered PIN. 

## Motivation 

As it is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO research group of the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in Germany it is optimized due to user's privacy.

## Installation

Further development requires Android Studio.
